# Fowl

**F# Numerical Computing Library**

A principled, type-safe scientific computing library for F#, inspired by [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz) (OCaml) and designed for production use.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Architecture phase complete, implementation in progress.

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete system design.

## Learning Resources

This repository includes comprehensive study notes:
- `memory/owl-tutorial/` - Owl tutorial chapter notes
- `memory/architecture-book/` - "Architecture of Advanced Numerical Analysis Systems" notes
- `memory/fsharp-learning/` - F# patterns and idioms

## Building

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Phase 1: Core Ndarray (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Phase 2: Math Primitives (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Phase 3: AD & Computation Graph (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Phase 4: Neural Networks (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Phase 5: Acceleration (Weeks 9-10)
