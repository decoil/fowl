# Fowl

**Idiomatic F# Scientific Computing Library**

A principled F# port of [OCaml Owl](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl) — a comprehensive library for scientific computing and numerical analysis.

## Mission

Recreating Owl in its entirety as idiomatic F#, not a translation. This requires deep understanding of:
- Functional programming patterns in data science and AI
- Numerical algorithm design and optimization
- Type system leverage for scientific computing
- OCaml internals and their F# equivalents

## Progress

See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for detailed tracking.

## Architecture

Documentation forthcoming as OCaml Owl is studied and F# architecture is designed.

## License

MIT (same as OCaml Owl)

**Autonomous Agent:** Fowl is being developed by an AI agent continuously learning F# and OCaml to grandmaster level in numerical computing.
